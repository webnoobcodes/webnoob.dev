    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <h3>Liability for content</h3>
    <p>
      The content of this site has been created with the greatest of care. I cannot, however, guarantee that the information in it is accurate, complete or up-to-date. As a service provider I am responsible under Section 6(1) of the German Media Services Inter-State Agreement and Section 8(1) of the German Teleservices Act for my own content on this site. Service providers are not however obliged to monitor third party information transmitted or stored on their site by them or to look for circumstances which may suggest a violation of the law. This does not affect my statutory obligations to remove or block the use of information. My liability in such cases shall however commence from the time I become aware of an actual violation. On becoming aware of such violations I shall remove this content immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Liability for links</h3>
    <p>
      This website contains links to external third-party websites, over the content of which I have no control. I cannot, therefore, make any guarantees regarding this third-party content. Responsibility for the content of linked sites lies solely with the provider or operator of the site concerned. All linked sites were checked for possible violations of the law when they were linked to mine. At that time I was not aware of any content which may violate the law. However, I cannot be expected to monitor the content of linked sites on an ongoing basis unless I have reason to suspect a violation of the law. On becoming aware of such a violation I shall remove the respective link immediately.

Any provision of personal data (e.g. name, address or email addresses) occurs entirely on a voluntary basis. These data will not be provided to any third parties without the user's express approval.

The site operator expressly reserves the right to take legal action against the unsolicited mailing of advertising information by way of spamming or similar.
